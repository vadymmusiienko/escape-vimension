# Game Design Document: Escape Vimension

## Game Overview

### Core Concept
In **Escape Vimension**, the player is a programmer who wants to write code faster with Vim. As a complete newbie, the player enters the Vim editor without knowing how to quit it. After spending hours trying to exit Vim, the player is shrunk down and trapped inside the code editor.  

To escape back to the real world, you—the player—must master Vim, with the ultimate goal of learning how to exit and return to reality. The journey of learning Vim is not as easy as it may seem. Along the way, you discover that some programmers have never made it back.  

Do you think you are built different? Can you master Vim? We will see…

### P.S. *What is Vim?*
Vim is a free, open-source, and highly configurable text editor that originated from the **vi** editor. Designed for efficiency and speed, it allows users to perform complex text-editing tasks entirely with keyboard commands through its command-line interface.  

It is also known to have a steep learning curve, since most of us are used to relying on a mouse to move between lines. In Vim, you use the keyboard for everything!

## Story and Narrative

### Backstory
You’re a college student working late on a programming project. Frustrated with your slow editing speed, you stumble upon Vim. Eager to improve, you open a terminal and type `vim .`.  

Confused, you realize you have no idea how to edit code, navigate, or—most importantly—exit. In frustration, you mash through countless keyboard shortcuts, but nothing works… until you accidentally enter **Vim Tutor**. Suddenly, you’re shrunk down to the size of a microbe!  

Now, the only way to return to reality is to master Vim—by following the tutor and hoping it finally teaches you how to quit.

### Setting
The game takes place inside a stylized terminal environment that exists somewhere between the digital and physical worlds.  

- Giant letters and words form the landscape  
- Command prompts float in the air like platforms  
- Oversized desk objects (keyboards, coffee cups, sticky notes) serve as landmarks  

Each level represents a different "document" or "file" you must navigate through.

### Characters
- **The Player (You):** A tiny programmer trying to escape, shown as a small humanoid figure with a glowing cursor hovering above.  
- **The Vim Tutor (Voice/Guide):** A mysterious voice echoing through the terminal, teaching you commands.  
- **Lost Programmers:** Along the way, you encounter other programmers who failed to escape. They share their stories, warning that there may be no hope left.
