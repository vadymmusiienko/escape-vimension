# Project 2 Report

Read the [project 2
specification](https://github.com/feit-comp30019/project-2-specification) for
details on what needs to be covered here. You may modify this template as you
see fit, but please keep the same general structure and headings.

Remember that you should maintain the Game Design Document (GDD) in the
`README.md` file (as discussed in the specification). We've provided a
placeholder for it [here](README.md).

## Evaluation Plan

1. **Evaluation Techniques**
    - **Cooperative Evaluation**: Since VimLand involves learning through typing commands, cooperative evaluation enables real-time observation of how players interpret the tutorial and apply the commands. Compared to the traditional “Think Aloud” method, this technique allows players to ask the team clarifying questions during the game play, helping the team identify areas that could cause any confusion, lack of clarity, or ineffective delivery.
    - **Post-Task Walkthrough**: This method allows the team to identify overall game experience and collect direct feedback on the level design, pacing, and command learning.
    - **Interview**: Interviews provide deeper qualitative insights into the overall player experience, including what aspects of the game they found engaging, confusing, or memorable. This helps uncover emotional and motivational responses that are not captured through observational methods.
    - **Survey/ Questionnaire**: Surveys efficiently gather quantitative data from multiple participants, measuring satisfaction, difficulty, and usability. They allow the team to analyse trends and overall player feedback using structured responses.

2. **Participants**
    - **Recruitment method**: As VimLand is an educational game designed to help beginners familiarise themselves with basic Vim commands, participants will be recruited from university peers.
    - **Target audience**: University students aged 18–25 with little or no prior experience using the Vim text editor.
    - **Number of participants**: Approximately 12 or more participants will be invited.

3. **Data Collection**
    - Type of data collected:
        i. Quantitative: Task completion time, number of deaths, task success rate
        ii. Qualitative: player feedback, overall satisfaction, and understanding of Vim commands.
    - Data collection methods: Observation notes during playtesting (Microsoft Word), post-task forms, and online surveys (SurveyMonkey)

4. **Data Analysis**
    - **Evaluation metrics**: average task completion time, average number of deaths, mean player satisfaction score, categorised themes from qualitative comments. 
    - These analyses will guide our team in identifying confusing design, pacing issues, or unclear instructions. Gaining users’ feedback can help us directly improve our gameplay design, and refine our tutorial clarity.

5. **Timeline**
    - Design evaluation materials, finalise survey and interview questions – week 10/ week 11
    - Invite and confirm participants – week 11
    - Conduct cooperative evaluations, walkthroughs, and surveys – week 11/ early week 12
    - Process and summarise findings, propose improvements – week 12

6. **Responsibilities**
    - Cooperative Evaluation: Conduct tests with three participants
    - Post-task Walkthrough: Conduct tests with three participants
    - Interview: Prepare questions and interview three participants
    - Survey: Create and distribute surveys to three participants

7. **Expected Outcomes**
    - Usability and interface feedback: Identify areas where instructions are unclear.
    - Improved player engagement and learning flow: Ensure command-based gameplay feels intuitive and rewarding.
    - Players’ overall satisfaction: Achieve positive post-game ratings on enjoyment and clarity.
    - Educational effectiveness: Demonstrate that players have gained familiarity with core Vim commands through gameplay.
